# Permissions:
# This workflow uses minimal required permissions following least-privilege principles
# - contents: read - Required to read repository files during checkout
# - pages: write - Required to deploy to GitHub Pages
# - id-token: write - Required for GitHub Pages deployment verification
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Concurrency Control:
# Ensures only one deployment runs at a time to prevent conflicts
# cancel-in-progress: false prevents canceling in-progress deployments
