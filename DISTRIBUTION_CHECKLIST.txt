DISTRIBUTION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Use this checklist when preparing the application for distribution.


BEFORE YOU SEND
================================================================================

[ ] Step 1: Create config.txt
    - Create a new file named "config.txt"
    - Put your OpenAI API key on the first line
    - Example: sk-proj-abc123def456...
    - Save the file

[ ] Step 2: Test Locally
    - Place config.txt in the same folder as ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
    - Drag a test contract onto the .exe
    - Verify it works correctly
    - Check that the JSON output is created

[ ] Step 3: Verify API Key
    - Make sure the API key in config.txt is correct
    - Check that your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
    - Consider setting usage limits in OpenAI dashboard

[ ] Step 4: Prepare Distribution Package
    - Create a new folder (e.g., "ContractAnalyzer")
    - Copy ContractAnalysisCLI.exe to the folder
    - Copy config.txt to the folder
    - Optional: Add USER_GUIDE.txt
    - Optional: Add QUICK_REFERENCE.txt


WHAT TO SEND
================================================================================

REQUIRED (2 files):
  ✓ ContractAnalysisCLI.exe    (from dist folder)
  ✓ config.txt                  (with your API key)

OPTIONAL (helpful for users):
  ○ USER_GUIDE.txt             (comprehensive instructions)
  ○ QUICK_REFERENCE.txt        (one-page quick start)

DO NOT SEND:
  ✗ Source code files (.py files)
  ✗ Build scripts (.bat files)
  ✗ requirements_simple.txt
  ✗ JSON schema files
  ✗ Any other files from the repository


PACKAGE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Your distribution folder should look like this:

  ContractAnalyzer/
  ├── ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
  ├── config.txt
  ├── USER_GUIDE.txt          (optional)
  └── QUICK_REFERENCE.txt     (optional)


HOW TO SEND
================================================================================

[ ] Step 5: Create ZIP File
    - Right-click on the ContractAnalyzer folder
    - Select "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
    - Name it: ContractAnalyzer.zip

[ ] Step 6: Choose Secure Distribution Method
    - OneDrive / SharePoint (recommended)
    - Secure file sharing service
    - Direct transfer (USB drive)
    - DO NOT email if possible (API key security)

[ ] Step 7: Send with Instructions
    - Send the ZIP file
    - Include a message like:
      
      "Attached is the Contract Analysis Tool. Extract the ZIP file
       and see USER_GUIDE.txt for complete instructions. The basic
       usage is: drag a contract PDF onto ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
       and wait for the analysis to complete."


AFTER YOU SEND
================================================================================

[ ] Step 8: Monitor Usage
    - Check OpenAI usage dashboard regularly
    - Watch for unusual activity
    - Ensure usage stays within expected limits

[ ] Step 9: Be Available for Support
    - Respond to questions promptly
    - Help troubleshoot any issues
    - Refer users to USER_GUIDE.txt

[ ] Step 10: Track Distribution
    - Keep a list of who has the application
    - Note when you sent it
    - Track any issues reported


SECURITY REMINDERS
================================================================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT:

[ ] The config.txt file contains your API key in plain text
[ ] Only share with trusted users
[ ] Use secure channels for distribution
[ ] Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard
[ ] Monitor usage regularly
[ ] Consider using a separate API key for distribution
[ ] Rotate the key periodically


UPDATING THE API KEY
================================================================================

If you need to change the API key later:

[ ] Step 1: Create new config.txt with new key
[ ] Step 2: Send only the new config.txt file
[ ] Step 3: Instruct users to replace their old config.txt
[ ] Step 4: No need to send the .exe again


TROUBLESHOOTING SUPPORT
================================================================================

Common issues users may report:

"Window closes immediately"
  → Tell them to run from Command Prompt to see the error
  → Check that config.txt is in the same folder as .exe

"API key not found"
  → Verify config.txt is in the same folder as .exe
  → Check that config.txt contains the API key on first line

"Authentication failed"
  → Check if API key is still valid
  → Verify OpenAI account has credits
  → May need to send new config.txt with updated key

"Takes too long"
  → Normal for scanned PDFs (3-4 minutes)
  → Check their internet connection
  → Verify contract file isn't corrupted
