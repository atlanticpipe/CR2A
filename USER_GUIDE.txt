================================================================================
1. WHAT YOU RECEIVED
================================================================================

You should have received 2 files:

  ✓ ContractAnalysisCLI.exe    (42.5 MB) - The application
  ✓ config.txt                  (1 KB)   - Configuration file with API key

IMPORTANT: Keep both files in the same folder!


================================================================================
2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Required:
  ✓ Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit)
  ✓ Internet connection (for AI analysis)
  ✓ At least 100 MB free disk space

Optional (for scanned/image-based PDFs):
  ○ Tesseract OCR software
  ○ Poppler software
  
Note: Most contracts are text-based PDFs and don't need the optional software.


================================================================================
3. FIRST-TIME SETUP
================================================================================

STEP 1: Extract the Files
--------------------------

If you received a ZIP file:
  1. Right-click on the ZIP file
  2. Select "Extract All..."
  3. Choose a location (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
  4. Click "Extract"

You should now see a folder with:
  - ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
  - config.txt


STEP 2: Verify the Files
-------------------------

1. Open the folder where you extracted the files
2. You should see both files together:
   
   [📄] ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
   [📄] config.txt

3. DO NOT separate these files - they must stay in the same folder!


STEP 3: Test the Application
-----------------------------

1. Double-click on ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
2. You should see a black window (console) appear
3. It will show usage instructions
4. Press Enter to close the window

If you see this, the application is working correctly!

================================================================================
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: Window Flashes and Closes Immediately
-----------------------------------------------

Cause: The application encountered an error before it could display it.

Solution:
  1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type "cmd", press Enter)
  2. Navigate to the folder: cd "C:\path\to\folder"
  3. Run: ContractAnalysisCLI.exe "path\to\contract.pdf"
  4. You'll now see the actual error message
  5. Follow the instructions in the error message


Problem: "API key not found"
-----------------------------

Cause: The config.txt file is missing or in the wrong location.

Solution:
  1. Make sure config.txt is in the SAME folder as ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
  2. Open config.txt in Notepad to verify it contains the API key
  3. The API key should be on the first line
  4. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
  5. Try again


Problem: "Authentication failed" or "401 Unauthorized"
-------------------------------------------------------

Cause: The API key is invalid or expired.

Solution:
  1. Contact the person who provided the application
  2. They may need to provide a new API key
  3. They will update the config.txt file for you


Problem: "File not found"
--------------------------

Cause: The contract file path is incorrect.

Solution:
  1. Make sure the contract file exists
  2. Try using the full path: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\contract.pdf
  3. If the path has spaces, use quotes: "C:\My Documents\contract.pdf"
  4. Try copying the contract to the same folder as the .exe


Problem: Analysis Takes Too Long
---------------------------------

Expected Times:
  - Text-based PDF (10 pages): ~1 minute
  - Scanned PDF (15 pages): 3-4 minutes
  - Word document (10 pages): ~1 minute

If it takes longer:
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Large contracts (50+ pages) may take longer
  3. Scanned/image PDFs take much longer (requires OCR)
  4. Wait at least 5 minutes before canceling


Problem: "Tesseract not found" (for scanned PDFs)
--------------------------------------------------

Cause: You're trying to analyze a scanned/image-based PDF without OCR software.

Solution:
  1. Most contracts don't need this - try a different contract first
  2. If you need to analyze scanned PDFs, contact your IT department
  3. They can install Tesseract OCR software
  4. Or convert the scanned PDF to text first using Adobe Acrobat


Problem: No Output File Created
--------------------------------

Cause: Analysis failed or was interrupted.

Solution:
  1. Check the console window for error messages
  2. Make sure you pressed Enter to close (don't close the window manually)
  3. Check if you have write permissions in the contract's folder
  4. Try saving the contract to a different location (e.g., Desktop)
  5. Run the analysis again


Problem: Can't Open JSON File
------------------------------

Cause: No default program is set for .json files.

Solution:
  1. Right-click on the .json file
  2. Select "Open with"
  3. Choose "Notepad" or "Notepad++"
  4. Check "Always use this app to open .json files"
  5. Click OK


================================================================================
7. TIPS & BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

For Best Results
----------------

✓ Use text-based PDFs when possible (faster analysis)
✓ Ensure contracts are clear and readable
✓ Keep file names simple (avoid special characters)
✓ Save contracts in an easy-to-find location
✓ Keep the application files together in one folder
✓ Don't move or rename ContractAnalysisCLI.exe or config.txt


File Organization
-----------------

Recommended folder structure:

  Documents/
  ├── ContractAnalyzer/
  │   ├── ContractAnalysisCLI.exe
  │   └── config.txt
  └── Contracts/
      ├── Project1/
      │   ├── Contract.pdf
      │   └── Contract_analysis.json
      └── Project2/
          ├── Contract.pdf
          └── Contract_analysis.json


Batch Processing
----------------

If you have multiple contracts to analyze:

  1. Analyze them one at a time
  2. Wait for each to complete before starting the next
  3. Keep track of which contracts you've analyzed
  4. Review results as you go


Security
--------

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
  - Don't share the config.txt file with others
  - Don't email or post the config.txt file
  - Keep the application files in a secure location
  - Only analyze contracts you're authorized to review


================================================================================
8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: How much does it cost to analyze a contract?
A: The cost depends on the contract size. Typically:
   - 10-page contract: ~$0.01-0.02
   - 20-page contract: ~$0.02-0.03
   - 50-page contract: ~$0.03-0.05
   The person who provided the application covers these costs.

Q: Can I analyze the same contract multiple times?
A: Yes! Each analysis will overwrite the previous results file.

Q: What file formats are supported?
A: - PDF files (.pdf) - both text-based and scanned
   - Word documents (.docx)
   - NOT supported: .doc (old Word), .txt, images

Q: Is my contract data secure?
A: The contract is sent to OpenAI's servers for analysis. OpenAI has
   security measures in place, but you should only analyze contracts
   you're authorized to share with a third-party service.

Q: Can I use this offline?
A: No, an internet connection is required for the AI analysis.

Q: Can I analyze contracts in other languages?
A: The tool is optimized for English contracts. Other languages may
   not produce accurate results.

Q: What if the analysis is wrong?
A: The AI provides analysis based on the contract text, but it's not
   a substitute for legal review. Always have important contracts
   reviewed by a qualified attorney.

Q: Can I customize the analysis?
A: No, the analysis follows a predefined structure. Contact the person
   who provided the application if you need different analysis criteria.

Q: How do I update the application?
A: You'll receive a new ContractAnalysisCLI.exe file when updates are
   available. Replace the old file with the new one. Keep the same
   config.txt file.

Q: Can I install this on multiple computers?
A: Yes, just copy both files (ContractAnalysisCLI.exe and config.txt)
   to each computer. They must stay together in the same folder.

Q: What happens if I lose the config.txt file?
A: Contact the person who provided the application. They can give you
   a new config.txt file.
